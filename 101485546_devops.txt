Course Overview 

COMP 3104 – DevOps teaches students the main ideas, tools, and methods that link software development with 
operations. The class covers automation, teamwork, continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), 
and cloud management — all important skills for today’s technology professionals.


Tools and Learning Focus

Students work directly with tools such as Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Travis CI, Docker, and Jira. They learn how to 
manage versions of code, automate building processes, set up continuous integration and delivery pipelines, and 
use testing methods. They also study scripting and how to track projects, which helps them use DevOps practices 
in actual work environments.


Evaluation and Outcomes

Assessments consist of labs, quizzes, assignments, and exams, and some of them let students use AI but only 
following specific rules. By the end of the course, students develop the technical and professional skills needed 
for DevOps careers, covering topics like automation, cloud technologies, and current industry trends.
