Better Teamwork

Learning DevOps helps bring together development and operations teams, making communication and teamwork better. 
This works together to cut down on delays, improve how things are coordinated, and make the software delivery process
 run more smoothly all through the development cycle.

 Faster Software Updates

 DevOps practices such as automation, continuous integration, and continuous deployment enable teams to release
  software updates more quickly and with fewer mistakes. This results in more consistent testing, faster resolution 
  of bugs, and improved overall product performance.
